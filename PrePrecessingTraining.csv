spy case new blow to cia could hurt recruit;the unmasking of another alleged moscow spy in its ranks dealt the cia a huge new blow possibly exposing dozens of undercover agents and details of how the us espionage agency does business around the worldwhat may be even worse for washington the case of alleged turncoat harold nicholson may scare away foreigners targeted for recruitment and dry up contacts with private us citizens who provide information intelligence professionals saidpeople are going to be a little bit leery of playing closely with uncle sam because they fear that there might be another mole hidden there inside the cia said david whipple of the association of former intelligence officers a 35year veteran of the cias operations directoratenicholson 46 was arrested by the federal bureau of investigation last saturday and charged with selling secrets including the identity of fellow clandestine cia officers to moscow for at least two yearsan instructor at the central intelligence agencys training camp for undercover operatives in virginia he may have given away recruitment techniques spy skills and tricks and agenthandling procedures us officials fearoverseas recruiting is a key part of what cia operatives like nicholson do to penetrate hostile governments criminal gangs and guerrilla groups groups targeted include drug runners nuclear proliferators and those who would steal us national security secretsanything that tends to dry up cia sources is a body blow and this has to have that effect said marvin ott a former cia analyst and senate intelligence committee staff member who is now a professor at the national war collegeus officials fear nicholson also turned over the names of cia recruits he helped train from 1994 until four months ago cia director john deutch said on wednesday that there is no question that the discovery of his alleged betrayal had devastated morale at the agencynicholson allegedly began his doublecrossing only weeks after the arrest of cia officer aldrich ames in february 1994 ames pleaded guilty to selling out to the kgb every top soviet and east european military and intelligence officer secretly working for the cia and the fbiunlike in the ames case where at least 10 of those foreigners were reportedly killed the cia says it knows of no deaths tied to nicholson who worked in the philippines thailand japan romania and malaysia in his 16year careerbut the task of persuading someone to spy against their own country always difficult has now been complicated by a possible perception that the cia may have chronic problems keeping its secretsthe fbi says it found a computer diskette in nicholsons car containing seven summary reports about cia access agents private citizens such as business people who briefed the agency after they had traveled to russiapaul joyal who helped develop and enforce counterspy procedures as director of security at the senate intelligence committee from 1985 to 1989 said nicholsons ability to get such files unrelated to any legitimate need to know pointed to a glaring flaw in cia securityit shows a lack of proper compartmentation joyal said referring to the basic spy agency practice of limiting employees access to data needed to do their jobs the cia declined comment citing ongoing investigationsstunned by a torrent of leaks of highly classified intelligence reports to the washington times newspaper defense secretary william perry warned in july that such disclosures could lead other countries intelligence agencies to believe the us to be an unreliable collaboratorthe cias task of signing up foreigners has also been complicated by the end of the cold war previously there had been an ideological appeal to be made that was very powerful said ott it could persuade someone that their higher loyalty was not to the soviet union but to certain values an argument that may no longer apply he ad;0
us official admits ciafbi bungle in spy cas;despite cia and fbi boasts that their cooperation led to the arrest of an accused moscow spy in the cia a us official admitted on thursday the two agencies bungled another recent russian espionage casei dont think anyone would claim that was a triumph of cooperation associate attorney general john schmidt said of the espionage case in which us charges had to be suddenly dropped against former soviet kgb agent vladimir galkina week ago the justice department citing the national interest was forced to drop spy charges against galkin after cia director john deutch warned that moscow would retaliategalkin was arrested by fbi agents on october 29 at john f kennedy airport in new york on charges of conspiring to steal topsecret information about the star wars defence programme a spacebased missiledefence programme initiated under president ronald reagan in the 1980sthe justice department said the cia had been told in advance of the proposed move on galkin and raised concerns but did not state sufficent objection to block the arrestmoscow protested and the episode created a diplomatic embarrassment resolved by galkins release he had retired from espionage work some time ago and in any case agents who operate from abroad as he had are customarily expelled rather than arrested if they enter the target countryat a justice department news briefing schmidt said that episode was kind of a footnote in what is the larger pattern of effective ongoing cooperation now being pressed by deutch and fbi director louis freehin announcing on monday the arrest of veteran cia officer harold nicholson on charges of spying for moscow for cash since june 1994 both deutch and freeh proudly cited the unprecedented level of cooperation between their agenciesthe central intelligence agency which is charged with running intelligence operations abroad and the federal bureau of investigation which is supposed to guard the united states against foreign espionage have a history of friction and rivalry as they pursue sometimes overlapping operationsa lack of cooperation between them hampered the investigation of cia turncoat aldrich ames who pleaded guilty in 1994 to spying for moscow since 1985in the galkin case schmidt said there was a question of whether the matter had reached the appropriate levels within the various agencies he added it may be more an internal matter for the agencies than something that really relates to the issue of cooperation between themschmidt also rejected complaints by nicholsons defence lawyer jonathan shapiro that the public comments by deutch and freeh would prevent his client from getting a fair trialthese are matters of large public importance and when events like this occur i think that people in those kinds of positions agency directors have an obligation to talk about them publicly he saidthe two have gone to unusual lengths to showcase fbicia harmony in appearances since the nicholson arrest including a joint interview on cnn on wednesday in which they expressed confidence the government has a strong case against him;0

questions on ferry safety 10 years after herald;on a blustery friday night in march 10 years ago 191 men women and children were drowned when the rollonrolloff ferry herald of free enterprise capsized as it left the belgian port of zeebrugge on the way to doverthe memory is still clear harbour master ignace vergult who was not on duty on the night of march 6 1987 but who was called in told reuters by telephonewe hope that it will never ever happen again ferry safety has improved since then but whether it has improved enough is another question he saidsurvivors and the relatives of the dead will hold memorial services in dover and zeebrugge on sunday after which the british herald families association will be quietly be wound upthe pain has been too much they feel they have done all they can mark watts british labour member of the european parliament for east kent told reuters in an interviewas politicians we have a responsibility to maintain the momentum he saidwatts agrees with vergult that passenger ferry safety has improved a bit since the herald went down but he argues strongly that there is far far more still to be doneif an aircraft had a design fault the fleet would be grounded but ferries are allowed to sail with fundamental design flaws he saidthe herald rolled over and sank in shallow water because it had become unstable due to taking on water through leaving port with the bow doors openimmediately after a number of changes were made to enhance ferry safety notable among these were the installation of inner doors to supplement the main outer doors and a signalling system to prevent the ferry leaving dock with the outer doors openbut ferry companies resisted other recommendations such as installing watertight bulkheads on car decks and making a full passenger list moves they still argue againstthe business of finding and identifying the dead from the herald was made considerably harder by the fact that no one knew how many people were on boardit was not until the ferry estonia sank during a storm in the baltic killing most of the 867 passengers and crew in september 1994 that the issue gained new momentumnothing really happened after the herald sank a few minor technical changes were made but nothing that addressed the fundamental issues watts saidit was not until the estonia went down that things started to happen againsince the estonia sank we have had the stockholm agreement on maritime safety but even that does not go far enough because it does not insist on the fundamental design changes that were proposed after the herald sank he addedwatts said one of the main problems was the reluctance of the ferry operators particularly those on the crosschannel run where they are facing tough competition from each other and the channel tunnel to incur extra costs there was also he said the problem that there is no single organisation either competent or capable of policing the seasthere are a whole myriad of organisations apparently enforcing the law we feel there should be one single body watts said adding that although the international maritime organisation did have powers it could only act by unanimitypeoples lives are being put at risk is it going to take another herald or estonia before we take the whole issue seriously he said;0
